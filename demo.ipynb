    "# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "House price prediction is a common task in real estate and property markets. It involves estimating the value of a house based on various factors such as the number of bedrooms, the size of the house and other relevant features. Linear regression is a widely used statistical technique that can be applied to predict house prices based on these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Python code, we will demonstrate how to build a simple linear regression model to predict house prices. We will use a dataset that contains information about different houses, including their features and corresponding prices. The goal is to train a regression model that can accurately estimate house prices based on the provided features."

This is a problem when using one hot encoding to encode categorical features. One hot encoding creates a matrix with a column for each category. If there are too many categories, then the matrix $X^TX$ will not be invertible. This is known as the dummy variable trap. To avoid this problem, we can use a technique called one hot encoding with dummy variables. This technique creates a matrix with a column for each category minus one. This ensures that the matrix $X^TX$ is invertible.\n",
